Clear output display for definitions.
Error handling for missing definitions or invalid line formats in the word list.
Requirements:

Python 3.x

Select "Nahuatl" from the language dropdown menu (currently only supports Nahuatl).
Choose a word from the Nahuatl word dropdown menu.
Click the "Translate" button.
The definition of the selected word will be displayed in the output text box.
Notes:

This application is currently focused on Nahuatl translation.

The word list format is assumed to be comma-separated: word, definition.
The application includes error handling for lines with missing commas or other formatting issues in the word list.
